# MyPokeApp

MyPokeApp allows you to review information in detail of each pokemon that exists (and there are more than 800 at the moment), thanks to the fact that this app consults the information directly to the **pokemon API**, so it will always be updated with each of our friends that are coming out (it is very normal that every year we have a new pokemon), *so you can be the best pokemon master, and you will know more about the fantastic world of Pokemon*.

To access the list with all the pokemon, you just have to log in using a gmail account, and that's it, it's very easy!

This mini project is part of the exercises done in the specialization course about **React JS and Redux** taught by [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-react-js/).
